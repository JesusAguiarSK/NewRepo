/*Images:
    img: html, when img is part of the content. e.g.: portfolio, statistics results, etc. It can be used:
    If you rely on browser scaling to render an image in proportion to text size.
    Improve performance of animations over a background.

    background image: : css, when img is for asthetic purposes It can be used:
        When doing image-replacement of text eg. paragraphs/headers. 
        If you need to improve download times, as with CSS sprites. 
        If you need for only a portion of the image to be visible. 
        background-image with background-size:cover in order to stretch a background image to fill its entire window */

/* Positions
    Static: Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document. 
            Usage:
                E.g., For simple, single-column layouts where each element must sit on top of the next one.

    Relative: set the object away 'x' pixels to the right, left, bottom
              top from the static (default) position. 
            Usage:
               E.g., when you need ot move things up based on a reference point.  
    
    Fixed: relative to the viewport, so it always stays the same, even when page is scrolled. 
            Usage:
                E.g., a chat window, a logo, etc.

    Absolute: positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. 

            Usage: 
                 E.g., when you need to make nested elements.

    Sticky: behaves like a relatively positioned element until a certain scroll point and then it acts like a fixed element. 
            based on the user's scroll position.

            Usage:
                E.g., headings in an alphabetized list.
